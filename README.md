Simple Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) in PHP & MySQL



This is a simple web application where a user  can register, then proceed to login.
A user can not access the dashaboard after signing up unless her or she logs in. 
Once a user is logged in, he or she can can add a post/ blog, the user can then edit the post if he wants to

When you visit the site, the first page is the index.php, a page where anyone can see posts of different users but the user cannot enjoy the CRUD services unless logged in.

The site was depolyed on 000webiste and below is the link

I have also uploaded my Sql file for those interested you can download it and import it on your database and test the system, locally.

Below is a simple Use case diagram used to define the funstional and non-funtional requirements of a system.

You can only edit once you have uploaded a blog, your post will be uploaded at the bottom of the file. As a user, since you will be on session, you can edit or delete the post.
